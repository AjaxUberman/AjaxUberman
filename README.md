## Hi there üëã

Hello! I'm **Baris Kayikci**, a Front-End Developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences. My journey into the world of coding began after graduating from Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University with a degree in Cinema-TV. While I initially embarked on a career in the industry, my fascination with technology led me to transition into the realm of web development.

With two years of professional experience under my belt, I have found myself drawn to the artistry and precision of front-end development. Now, I immerse myself in the world of code, where I blend creativity with technical expertise to bring ideas to life on the digital canvas.
